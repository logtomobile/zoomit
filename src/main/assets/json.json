In some ways, the Apple Watch was more of a competitive threat to existing smartwatch developers before it was announced earlier this month. As expected, at $349 the Apple Watch is expensive compared to most existing offerings. That's why some of existing iPhone users might prefer to purchase some other smartwatch. Companies selling Android Wear would still want iPhone customers, and some iPhone owners might want Android Wear."},
					{"level": 2, "text": "In some ways, the Apple Watch was more of a competitive threat to existing smartwatch developers before it was announced earlier this month.\n\nNow that more details are known, there's good and bad news for competitors. First, the bad news. As expected, the exquisite design of the Apple Watch hardware, software and interface looks poised to outshine other wearable temptations. Apple is making a strong commitment to the category with the largest assortment of models and accessories in its history of entering new categories.\n\nBut there's also good news for competitors. As expected, at $349 the Apple Watch is expensive compared to most existing offerings, and we can certainly expect the 18-karat versions to be at a significant premium to that. It works only with an iPhone, and in fact requires an iPhone to work. And if you're looking for a round product like the Moto 360 or the LG G Watch R, you'll have to look elsewhere, specifically in the direction of Android Wear.\n\nGoogle's smartphone platform includes many smartwatches priced at least $100 below the base Apple Watch. In addition, the Moto 360 is no slouch when it comes to design. Apple has indicated that its smartwatch should get about a day of battery life, and while early Moto 360 users have had varying results, that's possible for the Android Wear flagship as well. Indeed, we are likely to see more Android Wear devices launched, or at least announced at CES in January, before the Apple Watch is in the hands of consumers sometime in early 2015.\n\nAt the release of Android Wear, Google left open the question of whether the device category would work with iPhones. With lower prices and strong design, a fair amount of demand would likely be there, at least judging by the number of iPhone users who have embraced the Pebble watch; Android Wear would fall somewhere between that device's base model and the Apple Watch in terms of price and design. Also, while Android Wear supports apps, the core experience is centered on Google Now, for which Apple has nothing directly comparable, given that Siri is still reactive."}
